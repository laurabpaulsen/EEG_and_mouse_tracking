# EGG_and_mouse_tracking
Code used for running experiment using both mouse-tracking and EEG.

Tasks:
    [ ] End trial when you click on either of the bottons
    
    [ ] Put right triggers in the right places
    
        [ ] Trigger for key press?
        
    [ ] Check that right and left img + buttons are in the right places
    
        [ ] When done make buttons transparent
        
    [ ] Calculate reaction time
    
    [X] Decide when the mouse should return to original position (maybe when images are shown?) - otherwise you can move the mouse beforehand
    
    [ ] Fix monitor things - currently only works when fullscreen = False
    
    [ ] Set up experimental trials as well'
    
        [ ] Figure out how to repeat three times (do we just copy and paste in the csv-file or is there a smart code implementation)
        
    [ ] Fix merged dataframe
    
        [ ] Calculate velocity of mouse
        
    [ ] Decide on max length of trial and change it 
    
    [ ] Should if frame == 1 be changed to 0??
    
    [ ] Fill out structure in the beginning of .py file
